title: 'Two Forms of Pre-rendering'

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me.  I ain't the sharpest tool in
the shed:
```js
const test = require('testing')

test.describe('this is a test', () => {
  return true;
});

console.log('Hello World');
```
