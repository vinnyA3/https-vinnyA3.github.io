My Personal Website
===

Here lies the source for my personal website/blog.  Things are pretty bare at
the moment--I recently migrate the project over from [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) to [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

Stay tuned for the new architecture & design; and, of course, more blog content
:fire:.
