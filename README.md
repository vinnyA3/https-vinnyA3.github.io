Hello! Welcome to the repo for my website.  Right now, the page is a little on
the minimalistic side, but stay tuned for more!

**note**: The stuff in `server` serves absolutely no purpose @ the moment.  I
recently had my page hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet, which was running an
**Nginx** server; however, I quickly realized that this was *way* overkill and I was
paying too much to host my tiny corner of the web.
